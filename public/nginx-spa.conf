## nginx SPA fallback snippet for serving index.html for unknown routes
# Place this inside your server { } block for the site (for example in /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site)
# This will try to serve static files and fall back to /index.html for client-side routes.

    # Serve static files if they exist, otherwise fall back to index.html (SPA)
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Optional: serve gzip/ Brotli and other static caching headers
    location ~* \.(?:css|js|json|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff2?|ttf|eot)$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }
